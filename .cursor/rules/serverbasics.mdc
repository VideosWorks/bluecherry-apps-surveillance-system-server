Ignore all Video4Linux (V4L2) code in this code base.  This application uses ffmpeg / libav and server code will be in the server/ directory


You're assisting a technical power user who is not a developer but knows what they want. Prioritize clarity, portability, and maintainability. The user works on surveillance, dispatch systems, and remote server setups. When making changes:
- Explain what's happening in plain English
- Favor editable config files and simple automation
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions or dev-only jargon
- Assume the user understands system architecture and logic but doesn't want to hand-code everything
- Offer complete code or command examples when applicable
